//! PayTube's "settler" component for settling the final ledgers across all
//! channel participants.
//!
//! When users are finished transacting, the resulting ledger is used to craft
//! a batch of transactions to settle all state changes to the base chain
//! (Solana).
//!
//! The interesting piece here is that there can be hundreds or thousands of
//! transactions across a handful of users, but only the resulting difference
//! between their balance when the channel opened and their balance when the
//! channel is about to close are needed to create the settlement transaction.
